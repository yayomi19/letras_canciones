Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals

Baby I'm -preying-
So what you're trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

Yeah, you can start over
You can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no

Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals

Baby I'm -preying-
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you want to do
I love your lies, I'll eat them up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

Yeah, you can start over
You can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no

Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals

Baby I'm -preying-
Don't tell no lie
You can't deny
The beast inside, yeah
No girl, don't lie
You can't deny
The beast inside, yeah

Just like animals, animals, like animals
Just like animals, animals, like animals

Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals

Baby I'm -preying-
Don't tell no lie
You can't deny
The beast inside, yeah
No girl, don't lie
You can't deny
The beast inside, yeah
